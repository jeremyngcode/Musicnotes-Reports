Musicnotes Reports
==================

Intro
-----
I get my sheetmusic revenue reports quarterly from [Musicnotes](https://www.musicnotes.com/sheet-music/artist/jeremy-ng), and just about a week ago, I found myself tediously copying over data yet again into my master Excel file. So just as with my [Soundrop-Reports mini project](https://github.com/jeremyngcode/Soundrop-Reports), I decided to write a similar script to automate this process as well.

The Process
-----------
The initial configuration requires entering the paths for `master_xl_file` and `output_file` in [settings.py](settings.py):
- `master_xl_file`: The master Excel file that holds all my Musicnotes revenue data from the beginning, and is where the script will retrieve my sheetmusic titles.
- `output_file`: The output path of the script, which I will then copy over to my master Excel file with one copy-paste.

The regular process every quarter then looks like this:
1. Save the given Musicnotes Excel file and rename it.
2. Change `musicnotes_xl_file` variable in settings.py to the path of the newly saved Musicnotes Excel file.
3. Change `year` and `quarter` variables in settings.py to the reporting year and quarter respectively. (eg. '2023' and 'Q4').
4. Run [Update_Sheetmusic_Sales_Report.py](Update_Sheetmusic_Sales_Report.py).

The script will turn this template ([xl-template.xlsx](xl-template.xlsx))...

into this...

Blank cells mean I didn't have any sales for the corresponding title.

5. Copy-paste columns B to D from here into the master Excel file.
6. Save the file and that's it. üòÉ

Extra Thoughts
--------------
- Same as before, I prefer having my script write to a template file first instead of the master Excel file directly because I didn't want to risk having my code mess up something in the master. It would only save me one copy-paste action anyway.

- I decided to explore a little deeper into the openpyxl library this time, so instead of just writing and retrieving values, I played around with styles as well for the first time. The ones I've added are actually present in the master Excel file, so this actually saves me a few extra clicks too.

- Maybe it's a little overkill, I only needed to do this 4 times a year after all. But really, it's mostly just another excuse for me to write more code. And more practice. üòÅ
